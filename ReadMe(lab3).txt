I believe the time complexity for this algorithm will be n^2 due to the while loop I use that repeats n times, for loop that goes through i n times
The space complexity would be 1 due to there being a set array, that contains strings.
My code works, but the only thing I couldn't fix was how the first index 0, whether it was sorted or not would remain 0.
